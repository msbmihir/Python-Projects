    <h3><strong>Why I love Butter Chicken?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    <em>
        Butter Chicken simmers in a buttery tomato sauce and is punctuated by several special spices and herbs. Skip the Indian takeout and cook up your very own version of the popular dish!
        Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that’s first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.
        Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.
        For the creamyness & the flavour butter chicken has been & will definetly be my favourate for ages.
